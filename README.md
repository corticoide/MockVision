# MockVision

Simulated IP cameras on a real network. Each camera joins your LAN with its
own IP and MAC, serves RTSP and the HTTP API its vendor profile describes,
and sends events to your VMS, NVR or backend. A web panel served by the node
manages them.

It is for testing software that consumes cameras without buying them and
without touching production devices. It simulates what a camera does towards
the outside; it does not replace one.

> **Status: technical demo.** One vendor profile, RTSP from a picture, three
> HTTP routes and a manual line-crossing event, end to end.
> [docs/DEMO-NOTES.md](docs/DEMO-NOTES.md) lists what is simplified.
> Leer en español: [README.es.md](README.es.md).

## What the demo does

- A camera created in the panel appears on the LAN with its own IP and MAC
  (macvlan). Before taking the IP it runs an ARP probe, and it announces
  itself with gratuitous ARP.
- RTSP streams looped from a picture: main, sub and third, as the profile
  defines them, in H.264, H.265 or MJPEG. Each picture is encoded once per
  stream setting and the loop costs almost no CPU.
- An HTTP API from a YAML profile, with Digest authentication: snapshot,
  device information and reading and writing a parameter.
- A line-crossing event, triggered from the panel and sent to a target with
  an HTTP POST. Every delivery is logged with its status and latency.
- Metrics for each camera (CPU, RAM, clients). A camera is refused, with the
  reason, when it would go over the camera limit or the node's resources.
- A panel that updates live over a WebSocket.

## Requirements

- Linux on amd64 or arm64: Debian 12 or 13, Ubuntu 24.04 or later, or
  Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit. The kernel needs macvlan.
- **A wired network.** macvlan gives every camera an extra MAC, and Wi-Fi
  does not accept extra MACs. Switches with port security can block them
  too. In a VM, the hypervisor must allow promiscuous mode or MAC changes.
- Docker with Compose v2, or a native install with FFmpeg and systemd.
  Docker Desktop on Windows or macOS does not work, because it runs behind
  NAT.

## Quick start with Docker

```sh
git clone https://github.com/corticoide/MockVision.git
cd MockVision
docker compose up -d   # builds the image the first time
```

Open `http://<node>:8080`. On the first visit the panel asks you to create the
administrator; there are no default credentials. Then:

1. **Profiles → Import profile:** choose `profiles/milesight-demo.yaml`. It
   is validated and listed as *Draft*.
2. **Targets → New target:** enter the URL that should receive the events,
   for example `http://192.168.1.10:8000/events`.
3. **Cameras → New camera:** enter a free IP address of your LAN and pick the
   target. The camera starts and turns *Running*.

From **another device** on the same LAN (IP `192.168.1.50` and password
`secret` are examples):

```sh
ping 192.168.1.50
ip neigh show 192.168.1.50   # the camera's own MAC, not the node's
ffprobe rtsp://admin:secret@192.168.1.50:554/main   # also /sub and /third
curl --digest -u admin:secret -o snapshot.jpg http://192.168.1.50/snapshot.cgi
curl --digest -u admin:secret "http://192.168.1.50/cgi-bin/operator/operator.cgi?action=get.system.information"
curl --digest -u admin:secret "http://192.168.1.50/cgi-bin/operator/param.cgi?action=set&Image.Brightness=70"
curl --digest -u admin:secret "http://192.168.1.50/cgi-bin/operator/param.cgi?action=get&name=Image.Brightness"
```

The camera user is the one entered when the camera was created. If the
password was left empty, the camera uses the profile's factory account
(`admin` / `ms1234`). Press **Line crossing** on the camera: the target
receives the POST, and **Events** shows the delivery, the HTTP status and the
latency.

> **Test from another device.** Linux does not let a host reach its own
> macvlan interfaces. The node therefore cannot open its cameras' streams,
> and its cameras cannot deliver events to a receiver running on the node.
> Put the client and the targets on other machines. The panel's snapshot
> preview works anyway, because it does not use the network.

### Automation with API tokens

Create a token in **Settings → API tokens**; it is shown once. Scripts and
CI send it as a Bearer header, with no cookie or custom header:

```sh
TOKEN=mvt_…   # from Settings
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://<node>:8080/api/v1/cameras?state=running"
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"action":"stop","ids":["<camera id>"]}' http://<node>:8080/api/v1/cameras/actions/bulk
```

A read token can only query the node (and open the WebSocket); a write
token can change it, except tokens, which are managed from the panel only.
**Audit** shows every change with where it came from: the panel, the API
with the token's name, a client of a camera's emulated API, or the node.

### Background jobs

Encoding a stream and importing a package run as jobs (**Jobs** in the
panel, `/api/v1/jobs` in the API), with their progress and history. At most
two run at once (**Settings → Limits**); the rest wait in the queue.
Closing the browser stops nothing, and a job cut short by a restart stays
*Interrupted* until you resume it from its last checkpoint. **Prepare
renditions** encodes up front every stream the cameras need, so starting
many of them waits for nothing; when one fails it asks whether to retry,
skip it or stop, and skips it if nobody answers within ten minutes. A job
waiting for an answer does not hold back the others.

### Streams and codecs

A camera encodes the same picture once per use, as real ones do: the
**main** stream for recording, a light **sub** stream for grids and phones,
and a **third** one, often MJPEG, for simple clients. Each has its RTSP
address (`rtsp://<ip>/main`, `/sub`, `/third` with the demo profile), shown
in the camera's **Media** tab with its snapshot. Codec, resolution, frame
rate, bitrate and GOP change there, or from the camera's own API, when the
profile binds a parameter to them; the stream is encoded again and the
camera switches to it without restarting.

- **H.264** plays in every client. **H.265** needs about half the bitrate for
  the same picture, but not every client plays it. **MJPEG** sends every
  frame as a JPEG; over RTSP it carries at most 2040×2040 in multiples of 8.
- A client that connects gets a keyframe at once, as from a real encoder.

### Configuration

`compose.yaml` passes the two settings most installs need. Others go in its
`environment` section.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `MOCKVISION_LISTEN` | `:8080` | Address of the panel and the API; use `<ip>:<port>` to listen only on a management IP |
| `MOCKVISION_PARENT_IF` | default route's interface | Interface the cameras attach to; the panel's Settings can change it |
| `MOCKVISION_DATA` | `/data` | Database, node key, pictures and encoded streams |
| `MOCKVISION_FFMPEG` | `ffmpeg` | FFmpeg binary |
| `MOCKVISION_SECURE_COOKIES` | off | `1` behind an HTTPS reverse proxy |
| `MOCKVISION_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | none | Extra origins (`host:port`) allowed to call the API |
| `MOCKVISION_LOG_LEVEL`, `MOCKVISION_LOG_FORMAT` | `info`, text | `debug`…`error`; `json` |
| `MOCKVISION_SERVICE_USER`, `MOCKVISION_CAMERA_USER` | `mockvision`, `mockvision-cam` | Users of the main service and of the cameras |

The limits (maximum cameras, RAM and CPU thresholds, event retention) are set
in **Settings**.

### Without Docker

Install FFmpeg, build (`make build`, needs Go 1.27 and Node 22) and install
the binary with the systemd unit in
[deploy/mockvision.service](deploy/mockvision.service); its header lists the
steps.

## How it works

One binary runs as three kinds of process:

```
mockvision run      root, 9 capabilities   network helper: namespaces, macvlan, ARP, launching cameras
 └─ mockvision serve   uid mockvision, none   panel, REST API, WebSocket, SQLite, reconciler, FFmpeg
 └─ mockvision camera  uid mockvision-cam, none   one per camera, inside its namespace sim-<name>
```

- The **network helper** is the only privileged process. It accepts a closed
  set of validated requests from the service over a private socket. It never
  runs a shell.
- The **main service** keeps the desired state in SQLite and reconciles it
  with the kernel at boot and every 10 seconds. Cameras with autostart come
  back after a restart.
- Each **camera** gets its sockets already open in its namespace. It drops
  every privilege before reading any input: no capabilities, a separate user
  and `no_new_privs`. It then serves the profile's engines (`rtsp`,
  `http-api`, `http-push`) and talks to the service in JSON lines.

Named namespaces make `ip netns exec sim-<camera> …` work for debugging (with
Docker: `docker compose exec mockvision ip netns`). Where Docker's AppArmor
profile forbids mounts, cameras use anonymous namespaces instead.

The architecture, profile format, API and decisions come from the project's
design document; `backend/internal/api/openapi.yaml` describes the REST API.

## Development

```sh
make dev                     # local mode: no privileges, cameras on 127.0.0.1 with their own ports
cd frontend && npm run dev   # panel with hot reload on :5173, proxied to the node on :8080
```

Local mode is for working on the panel, the API and the engines. It has no IP
or MAC on the LAN.

| Command | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `make test` | `go vet`, unit tests and the panel's type check |
| `make test-integration` | network namespaces and macvlan on a virtual link (root) |
| `make e2e` | the demo's acceptance criteria on an isolated virtual LAN (root, iproute2, ffmpeg, curl, python3) |
| `make e2e-compose` | the same criteria against the Docker image started with `compose.yaml` |
| `make generate` | sqlc queries and the panel's API types from `openapi.yaml` |

The binary must be built with `CGO_ENABLED=0`: dropping privileges changes
every thread at once, and only a pure Go binary can do that.

## Security

- The first run creates the administrator. Passwords use Argon2id, and
  repeated failures lock the login.
- Sessions are `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict` cookies. Every request that
  changes state needs a custom header and passes an `Origin` check. The
  panel runs under a strict CSP and loads nothing from other origins.
- Camera and target passwords are encrypted with XChaCha20-Poly1305. The key
  is kept outside the database, and the API never returns them.
- API tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes and shown once. They carry a scope
  (read or write), may expire, and are revoked at once from the panel. The
  audit log keeps every change for 90 days with its origin and IP.
- The panel is plain HTTP. Put it behind an HTTPS reverse proxy
  (`MOCKVISION_SECURE_COOKIES=1`) before exposing it beyond a lab network.
